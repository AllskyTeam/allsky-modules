| **Runs In**  | Night to Day Transition<br>Periodic (Enable only for testing!)   |


This module allows for automatically emailing nightly startrails, keogram, and timelapse images from a Gmail (or SMTP) account each morning.  Additionally it can create and send a composite startrails+keogram image which is a compressed keogram displayed below the startrails.  The timelapse can be sent in a separate email from the other images if required or desired (eg. due to file size).

**Prerequisites:**
 - Gmail or annother SMTP email server/service
 - Allsky must be configured to generate Startrails, Keogram, and/or Timeplapse and to store at least one day of images on the Pi.

### Notes:
 - For Gmail with MFA enabled you need an app password (not your regular login password). See [Sign in with app passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for details on how to setup.  _eg a 16-digit passcode used to give the script permission to access your Google Account to send email._

 - Gmail has a maximum attachment limit of 25MB.  If your files exceed the maximum allowed attachment size limit, then not all files will be attached.  You may have to modify timelapse creation options if that file is too large and you wish to send it via email.

 - This module can take a minute or more to complete depending on your Pi, internet connection, size of the files to be attached, etc.  Therefore it may make sense for this to be the last madule to run in your 'selected modules'

 - _Special Thanks to the prior work by Alex Greenland_, I referenced your disordsend module to get myself started with this one!
